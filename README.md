# PokeBotShinyFarmK8s
A project to learn Kubernetes. 

I'll be using [40Cakes's pokebot-gen3](https://github.com/40Cakes/pokebot-gen3) deployed in a docker and scaled out with kubernetes. 

This project is currently a big Work in Progress and this initial commit only includes my Dockerfile and entrypoint.
